# Nameless-Websend
Send commands from your website to your Minecraft server using the Websend plugin

## Requirements
- NamelessMC version 2 pre-release 11+
- Websend
    - [MC 1.8-1.12](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/websend)
    - [MC 1.13+](https://github.com/samerton/Websend/releases/tag/v2.5.11)

## Installation
- Upload the contents of the **upload** directory straight into your NamelessMC installation's directory
- Activate the module in the StaffCP -> Modules tab

Install the official namelessmc plugin. Run through its installation steps (configuring the api url, etc) and then go to its config and enable the websend module. Keep in mind you need to configure the server id for websend to work!

After this, submit it. You can then click on one of the hooks in the list and enable them / configure commands.
